- 👋 Hi, I’m @LitterPic
- 👀 I’m interested in saving our planet.  Collectively small actions have impacts, I'm starting with cleaning litter from roads, beaches, and parks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Django to create a new, better, version of LitterPic.com
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on environmental protection, and UX/UI improvements for LitterPic.com
- 📫 How to reach me by emailing contact@litterpic.com or calling LitterPic at 1.207.200.1496
